Note

Note to the first example: the i'th line of the output should contain the number of initial configurations, which lead the participant with strength equals to i to the final. There are two initial configurations for the first participant, since both permutations (1, 2) and (2, 1) lead him to the final. There are also two initial configurations for the second participant – (1, 2) and (2, 1).

Note to the second example: the i'th line of the output should contain the number of initial configurations, which lead the participant with strength equals to i to the final. For the first participant there is no such initial configuration, so the answer is equal to 0. For the second participant there are 8 configurations, for the third – 16, and for the fourth – 24.
