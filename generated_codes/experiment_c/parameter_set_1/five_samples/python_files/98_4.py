A:

My first thought is that the above is a game of Nim.
I did a bit of research and found this:
<blockquote>
<p>Nim is a two-player combinatorial game, played with a number of objects. Two players take turns removing objects from distinct piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same pile. The player who removes the last object wins.</p>
</blockquote>
So, the entire grid is one pile with $r \times c$ objects. The first move will remove $r+c$ objects, while the second move will remove $r+c-2$ objects, and so on. The number of objects at the start of the next move will always be the same (the number of objects on the board that are part of the current players prime cross).
So, you can calculate the size of the pile at the start of the next turn with:
$$n=r\times c-(r+c+r+c-2+r+c-4+\cdots)=r\times c-\frac{(r+c)(r+c-1)}{2}$$
Now that you have the Nim-sum of the initial position, you can use this table to determine who is going to win the game. From that table, you can see that $n=0$ would mean that Kirito has a win, while $n=1$ would mean that Asuna has a win.
$$n=r\times c-\frac{(r+c)(r+c-1)}{2}=r\times c-\frac{r^2+2r c+c^2-r-c}{2}=r\times c-\frac{r^2+c^2+r\times c-r-c}{2}=r\times c-\frac{(r+c)^2}{2}+\frac{r+c}{2}$$
So, you can use the formula:
$$n=r\times c-\frac{(r+c)^2}{2}+\frac{r+c}{2}$$
to calculate who is going to win the game.
