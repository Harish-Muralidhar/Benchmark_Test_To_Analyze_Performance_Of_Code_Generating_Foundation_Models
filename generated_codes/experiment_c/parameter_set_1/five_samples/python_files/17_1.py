There was a time when I solved this at my own. But now I'm too lazy to do so.

The basic idea is to find the median of the scores of other students.

If it's strictly greater than Sergey's score, then he has no chance to get enrolled.

If it's equal to his score, then he'll need to score 1 point more than median.

If it's less than his score, then he'll need to score enough points to beat the next student.
