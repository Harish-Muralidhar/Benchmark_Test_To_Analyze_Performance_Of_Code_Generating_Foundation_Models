A:

Asuna will always win.
The key here is noticing that there is always a path from any monster to the bottom of the grid - <code>#</code>s cannot be placed on the bottom row.
Asuna will always win if she makes the first move, and will always win if she makes the second move by blocking off the bottom row.
Proof by induction: Assume that Asuna will always win if she makes the second move. If Asuna makes the first move, she has a choice of where to put her volcano. If she places it in the bottom row, then Kirito will make the second move, and by the assumption will lose. If she does not place it in the bottom row, then Kirito will make the first move, and by the assumption will lose.
