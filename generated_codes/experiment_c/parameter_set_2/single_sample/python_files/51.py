Explanation
In the first case, employee 1 should get at least 10$ more than employee 2, employee 2 should get at least 20$ more than employee 3, employee 1 should get at least 40$ more than employee 3, and employee 2 should get at least 5$ more than employee 4. So, employee 1 should get at least 50$ more than employee 4. So, the minimum total bonus is 460$.

In the second case, employee 1 should get at least 10$ more than employee 2, employee 2 should get at least 10$ more than employee 3, and employee 3 should get at least 10$ more than employee 1. So, this is inconsistent, and itâ€™s not possible to distribute bonus among them.

Note: 

The bonus of each employee should be a non-negative integer.
