This is a game theory problem.
The game is a position game, so we can use the Sprague-Grundy theorem to solve it.
Let's define a function <code>g(x, y)</code> that returns the Grundy number of the cell <code>(x, y)</code>.
<code>g(x, y)</code> is defined as the minimum non-negative integer <code>k</code> such that <code>g(x, y) ^ g(x', y') != 0</code> for all <code>(x', y')</code> that are in the same row or column as <code>(x, y)</code> and <code>g(x', y') &lt;= k</code>.
If there are no such <code>(x', y')</code>, then <code>g(x, y) = 0</code>.
We can compute <code>g(x, y)</code> by the following recursive formula:
<code>g(x, y) = 0 if (x, y) is a wall
g(x, y) = 1 if (x, y) is not a wall and there are no other cells in the same row or column
g(x, y) = max(g(x', y')) + 1 otherwise
</code>
Once we have computed <code>g(x, y)</code> for all <code>(x, y)</code>, we can compute the Grundy number of the whole game by XORing all the <code>g(x, y)</code> for all <code>(x, y)</code> that are not walls.
If the Grundy number is 0, Asuna wins.
If the Grundy number is non-zero, Kirito wins.
