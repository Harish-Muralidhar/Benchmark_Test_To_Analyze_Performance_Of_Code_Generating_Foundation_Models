Explanation :

In the first test case, we can perform the following sequence of operations : { } -> {10, 10} -> {9, 11} -> {8, 12} -> {7, 13} -> {6, 14} -> {5, 15} -> {4, 16} -> {3, 17} -> {2, 18} -> {1, 19} -> {0, 20}


In the second test case, we can perform the following sequence of operations : { } -> {1, 2, 2} -> {2, 1, 3} -> {3, 2, 2} -> {4, 1, 3} -> {5, 2, 2} -> {6, 1, 3} -> {7, 2, 2} -> {8, 1, 3} -> {9, 2, 2} -> {10, 1, 3} -> {11, 2, 2} -> {12, 1, 3} -> {13, 2, 2} -> {14, 1, 3} -> {15, 2, 2} -> {16, 1, 3} -> {17, 2, 2} -> {18, 1, 3} -> {19, 2, 2} -> {20, 1, 3} -> {21, 2, 2} -> {22, 1, 3} -> {23, 2, 2} -> {24, 1, 3} -> {25, 2, 2} -> {26, 1, 3} -> {27, 2, 2} -> {28, 1, 3} -> {29, 2, 2} -> {30, 1, 3} -> {31, 2, 2} -> {32, 1, 3} -> {33, 2, 2} -> {34, 1, 3} -> {35, 2, 2} -> {36, 1, 3} -> {37, 2, 2} -> {38, 1, 3} -> {39, 2, 2} -> {40, 1, 3} -> {41, 2, 2} -> {42, 1, 3} -> {43, 2, 2} -> {44, 1, 3} -> {45, 2, 2} -> {46, 1, 3} -> {47, 2, 2} -> {48, 1, 3} -> {49, 2
