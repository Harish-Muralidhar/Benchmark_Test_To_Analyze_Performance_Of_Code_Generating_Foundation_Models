Explanation

In the first test case the only strictly increasing arithmetic progression with difference not less than 2 composed of numbers from the set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is the sequence (2, 4, 6).

In the second test case the only strictly increasing arithmetic progression with difference not less than 2 composed of numbers from the set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is the sequence (2, 4, 6).

In the third test case the strictly increasing arithmetic progressions with difference not less than 8 composed of numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32} are the sequences (5, 14, 23, 32), (5, 14, 23), (5, 14), (5, 14, 23, 32), (5, 14, 23), (5, 14), (5, 14, 23, 32), (5, 14, 23), (5, 14), (5, 14, 23, 32), (5, 14, 23), (5, 14), (5, 14, 23, 32), (5, 14, 23), (5, 14), (5, 14, 23, 32), (5, 14, 23), (5, 14), (5, 14, 23, 32), (5, 14, 23), (5, 14), (5, 14, 23, 32), (5, 14, 23), (5, 14), (5, 14, 23, 32), (5, 14, 23), (5, 14), (5, 14, 23, 32), (5, 14, 23), (5, 14), (5, 14, 23, 32), (5, 14, 23), (5, 14), (5, 14, 23, 32), (5, 14, 23), (5, 14), (5, 14, 23, 32), (5, 14, 23), (5, 14), (5, 14, 23, 32), (5, 14, 23), (5, 14), (5, 14, 23, 32), (5, 14, 23), (
