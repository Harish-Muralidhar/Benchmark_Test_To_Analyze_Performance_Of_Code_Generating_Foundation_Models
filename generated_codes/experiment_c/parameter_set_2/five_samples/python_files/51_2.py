Explanation

In the first case, employee 1 should get at least 140$ more than employee 2, employee 2 should get at least 120$ more than employee 3, and employee 1 should get at least 100$ more than employee 3. So, employee 1 should get at least 140+120=260$ more than employee 3. Also, employee 2 should get at least 120+100=220$ more than employee 4. So, employee 1 should get at least 260+220=480$ more than employee 4. So, the minimum total bonus is at least 480+100=580$. But, if we give 580$ to employee 1, and 100$ to employee 4, we can give 140$ to employee 2, and 120$ to employee 3. So, the minimum total bonus is 460$.

In the second case, employee 1 should get at least 10$ more than employee 2, employee 2 should get at least 10$ more than employee 3, and employee 3 should get at least 10$ more than employee 1. So, the comparisons are inconsistent, and itâ€™s not possible to distribute bonus among them.
