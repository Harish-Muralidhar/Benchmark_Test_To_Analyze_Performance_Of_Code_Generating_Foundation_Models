Explanation
In the first test case, the given comparisons are consistent. So, we can distribute bonus among them. The minimum total bonus is 460$. To achieve this, employee 1 can get 140$, employee 2 can get 120$, employee 3 can get 100$, and employee 4 can get 100$.
In the second test case, the given comparisons are inconsistent. So, we canâ€™t distribute bonus among them.
