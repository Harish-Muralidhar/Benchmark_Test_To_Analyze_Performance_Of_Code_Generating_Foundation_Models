In the first example, the Chef has prepared 4 appetizers numbered 0, 1, 2, and 3. The appetizers are arrayed in the order "chef" and the Chef intends to display the message "chef". The appetizers are finished in the order 2, 0, 1, and 3. The Chef writes the number of the appetizer on a piece of paper and places it beside the appetizer on the counter. The server picks up the number and places the appetizer in the location indexed by the number. The server reads the number upside down and places the appetizer in the location indexed by the number when it is read upside down. The server reads the number "10" upside down as "01" and places the appetizer in location indexed by 1. The server reads the number "00" upside down as "00" and places the appetizer in location indexed by 0. The server reads the number "01" upside down as "10" and places the appetizer in location indexed by 2.
