I think this is a game of Nim.
Let's consider the number of monsters in each row and column. 

If there is an odd number of monsters in a row or column, then the player who goes first can win by placing a volcano in that row or column.
If there is an even number of monsters in a row or column, then the player who goes second can win by placing a volcano in that row or column.

So, if the number of monsters in each row and column is even, then the player who goes first can win.
If there is an odd number of monsters in some row or column, then the player who goes second can win.
