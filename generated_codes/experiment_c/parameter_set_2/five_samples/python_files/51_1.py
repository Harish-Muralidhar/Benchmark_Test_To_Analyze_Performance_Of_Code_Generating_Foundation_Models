Explanation

In the first test case, employee 1 should get at least 10$ more than employee 2, and employee 2 should get at least 20$ more than employee 3, so employee 1 should get at least 30$ more than employee 3. Also, employee 2 should get at least 5$ more than employee 4, so employee 1 should get at least 35$ more than employee 4. So, the minimum total bonus is 460$. 

In the second test case, employee 1 should get at least 10$ more than employee 2, and employee 2 should get at least 10$ more than employee 3, so employee 1 should get at least 20$ more than employee 3. Also, employee 3 should get at least 10$ more than employee 1, so employee 3 should get at least 10$ more than employee 2. This is a contradiction, so itâ€™s not possible to distribute bonus among them.
